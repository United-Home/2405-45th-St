Start with the Bathrooms:
    - Apt A: Take away the bathrugs so they're not sprayed with bleach. Spray the shower area (excluding the metals) and the toilet with bleach. Leave the area and focus on other things to do.
    - Apt B: Take away the bathrugs and be careful the bath curtain doesn't get sprayed with bleach. Spray the toilet only with bleach. Leave the area and focus on other things.
