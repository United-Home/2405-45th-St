1. **Start bathrooms first** - Allows bleach time to work while completing other tasks
2. **Group similar tasks** - Complete all vacuuming in one circuit  
3. **Work top to bottom** - Clean ceiling fans before floors
4. **Batch laundry loads** - Sort everything at once for efficiency
5. **Return to bathrooms last** - Maximizes bleach contact time
